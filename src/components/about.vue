            The Jazz Illustrators interpret Jazz, traditionally seen as foreign music, to suit
            the Nigerian audience who, sometimes, may not be conversant with Jazz. It therefore
            uses a blend of foreign and local music to promote African culture.
            The originality of Jazz Illustrators lies in the fusions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We primarily interprets
            Jazz music, in such a manner that every listener can easily find their expressions.
            The Jazz Illustrators, through its music, has been able to find a mid-point between
            Western Jazz music and African native music. That is taking native music abroad and
            bringing foreign jazz home to all and sundry.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are poised for promoting African native music and cultural
            values with the blend of foreign jazz music, however making the
            African native music recognized all over the world. Our interpretation of
            music is unconventional but unique in such that all kinds of audience can
            find their expression

            The Establishment of the band was an initiative of Onifade Oluseyi,
            popularly known as Fade De Great <i>(Fade Sax)</i>. The idea came in as a result of a
            constant yearning for a platform where talented musicians can come
            together to relate through their various instruments, to create a
            common platform for sharing of music related ideas, expression of
            musical prowess and also propagate the general acceptability of
            Jazz music in the Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria and African
            at large.
          </p>
          <p>
            The band came in to existence in 2013 with just few musically
            passionate friends: Onifade Oluseyi (Fade De Great) - saxophonist,
            Onifade Gbenga - Guitarist, Daniel Udah -Drummer, Doxa Uzen- Bassist,
            Gboyega Aliyu - Pianist, Ndiana Akpan – backup drummer. Our first live
            appearance in concert was the Jazz Explosion 2013, an event organized
            by the band. That initiated the idea of live Jazz performance with
            theatre art which was indeed a ground breaking event that announced
            the Jazz Illustrators in the Nigeria’s entertainment Industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jazz band became officially incorporated with the Corporate Affairs
            Commission of the Nigeria Republic in March 14th, 2016 with a mandate
            to carry on musical entertainment services, production, mentorship,
            adult and children music education and trainings, workshops and seminars,
            grooming of younger generations and lots more.
